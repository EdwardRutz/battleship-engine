# Javascript Testing - Battleship Engine

Test Driven Design with MOCHA and CHAI to create a game engine (no GUI) to play the classic game, Battleship.

- [ ] Work in Progress



## Tech & Dependencies

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Mocha
- Chai

## Install Project

- Download from git
- Install dependencies `npm install`

## Run Tests

- `npm test`


## Notes

- Install Mocha and Chai into a project: `npm install --save-dev mocha chai`
- To create a basic package.json file in project and select dependencies, use: `npm init`
- Mocha will test all files in the "test" folder.
- The test folder must be named "test" and be located in the same directory as package.json
- Create a test suit using the describe function.`describe('...', function(){...});
- `describe()` takes two arguments: 
    1. a string describing what test will cover, 
    2. an anonymous function which serves as a "wrapper" for all the unit tests in the test suite
- A unit test are also called "spec"
- Specs/unit tests are created by, `it('...', function(){...});` function.
- `it()` has two arguments: 
    1. a string stating what the function will test,
    2. a function with the expectations or state for the test to meet and pass

```
    describe(' ', function(){
    });
```
