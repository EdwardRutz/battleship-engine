# Javascript Testing - Battleship Engine

Test Driven Design with MOCHA and CHAI to create a game engine (no GUI) to play the classic game, Battleship.

- [ ] Work in Progress



## Tech & Dependencies

- Javascript
- NPM
- Mocha
- Chai

## Install Project

- Download from git
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Run Tests, `npm test`


## Notes

- A unit test are also called "spec"
- Install Mocha and Chai into a project: `npm install --save-dev mocha chai`
- To create a basic package.json file in project and select dependencies, use: `npm init`
- Mocha will test all files in the "test" folder. Naming the folder "Test", "tests", "Tests", etc. is invalid.
- The test folder must be named "test" and be located in the same directory as package.json
- Create a test suit containing unit tests using the describe function.
    ` describe('...', function(){...}); `
- Specs/unit tests are created by, ` it('...', function(){...}); ` function.
- The `it()` unit test has two arguments: 
    1. a string stating what the function will test,
    2. a function with the expectations or state for the test to meet and pass

```
    describe(' ', function(){
    });
``` 

### More BDD Assertions

- `.not`
- `.empty`, checks for empty objects, arrays, or strings.
- `.deep`, make deep equality comparisons. Similiar looking arrays are "deeply equal" because the deep internal value are equal.
- `.include`
- `.equal`
- `not.equal`
- `deep.equal`
